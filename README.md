# UM-SI670-Applied-Machine-Learning-Final-Project-Service-Express-Sales-Outcome-Prediction

## Introduction
Applied Machine Learning is meant to apply machine learning models to real world problems. As a result, we successfully earned the opportunity to deal with real world issues by using techniques and machine learning skills learned from the course. This is an external project cooperating with Service Express, a company that provides data center maintenance services to its customers. When there is a potential customer, the company would try to sell the services to the customer and track their interactions by creating an "opportunity". The company wins an opportunity if a service is successfully provided to a customer. The company would like to build a model to predict whether the company wins the opportunities from its potential customers, which can support sales teams and help them to make decisions. With a model of 85-90% accuracy, the company can point their sales leadership at larger opportunities where the model is predicting a loss and they can try to intervene earlier and provide assistance to help win the opportunity or if itâ€™s looking like the company will win the opportunity or will lose the opportunity and close the opportunity sooner to avoid unnecessary loss.
